# OWLS-FDplan

## About
OWLS-FDplan is a service composition planner: Given a service composition problem expressed in OWL-S 1.1 as input, OWLS-FDplan produces a set of plans solving that problem. This docu- ment gives users a complete example to use the OWLS-FDplan. 

It consists of two steps: 1) using OWLS2PDDL to convert OWL files into PDDL files; 2) invoking FastDownwardCaller on this PDDL representation to produce the set of plans (OWL-S).
